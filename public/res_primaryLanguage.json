I'm adept at coordinating, motivating and working within a team to reach our objective. I've always been interesting in computers, and after doing some research, coding really caught my interest.. Ideally I'd like to work with a team to design, create, and troubleshoot applications remotely, and I'd love the opportunity to develop my skillset further as an active member of a programming team.",
